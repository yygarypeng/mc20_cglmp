# mc20_cglmp

Truth-level study for the CGLMP entanglement variables.

1. Run ```mc20_truth_data.ipynb``` to generate the analysis data, and also do the sanity check. The raw data is retrieved from ```v2``` in QE group from Steffen's eos. The analysis data is saved in the ```h5``` format that will show up after running ```mc20_truth_data.ipynb```.
2. Carry out the analysis with ```ggm_analysis_cul.ipynb```. The algorithms are defined in ```alg.py```.
