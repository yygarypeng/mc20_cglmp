# mc20_cglmp

Truth-level study for the CGLMP entanglement variables.

Run ```mc20_cglmp.ipynb``` to generate the analysis data, also do the sanity check.
The raw data is retrieved from ```v2``` in QE group from Steffen's eos.
The analysis data is saved in the ```h5``` format that will show up after running ```mc20_cglmp.ipynb```.
Carry out the analysis with ```mc20_cglmp_analysis.py```.
The algorithm is defined in ```mc20_cglmp.py```.
